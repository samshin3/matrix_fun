This is a basic C program that does matrix multiplication given two valid matrices

I have plans to add more functions in the future, but the main purpose of this program is just to practice my C coding.
Recently, I watched a video by LaurieWired (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsZk3c7Oxyw) on optimizing Matrix multiplication, as it is traditionally an O(n^3) operation.
That got me motivated to write my own matrix functions and operations, which is where I am at the moment.
